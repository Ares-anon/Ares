    "description": "Fix error handling path in autovacuum launcher\n\nThe original code (since 00e6a16d01) was assuming aborting the\ntransaction in autovacuum launcher was sufficient to release all\nresources, but in reality the launcher runs quite a lot of code out of\nany transactions.  Re-introduce individual cleanup calls to make abort\nmore robust.\n\nReported-by: Robert Haas\nDiscussion: https://postgr.es/m/CA+TgmobQVbz4K_+RSmiM9HeRKpy3vS5xnbkL95gSEnWijzprKQ@mail.gmail.com\n",
