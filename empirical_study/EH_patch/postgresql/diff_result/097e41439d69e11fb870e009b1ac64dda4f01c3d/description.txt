Fortunately,\nthis didn't break anything because it happens to find hashm_bsize\nat the offset at which it expects to find pd_pagesize_version, and\nthe values are close enough to the same that this works out.\n\nStill, it's a bug, so back-patch to all supported versions.\n\nMithun Cy, revised a bit by me.\n",
