    "description": "Refactor permissions checks for large objects.\n\nUp to now, ACL checks for large objects happened at the level of\nthe SQL-callable functions, which led to CVE-2017-7548 because of a\nmissing check.  Push them down to be enforced in inv_api.c as much\nas possible, in hopes of preventing future bugs.  This does have the\neffect of moving read and write permission errors to happen at lo_open\ntime not loread or lowrite time, but that seems acceptable.\n\nMichael Paquier and Tom Lane\n\nDiscussion: https://postgr.es/m/CAB7nPqRHmNOYbETnc_2EjsuzSM00Z+BWKv9sy6tnvSd5gWT_JA@mail.gmail.com\n",
