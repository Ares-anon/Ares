    "description": "Add missing NO_INSTALLCHECK in commit_ts and test_rls_hooks\n\nThis bypasses installcheck if specified, which makes sense for those\nmodules as they require non-default configuration, something which\ntypical users don't have.  Those have been missing from the start, still\nno back-patch is done.\n\nThis will be used by an upcoming patch for MSVC scripts adding support\nfor NO_INSTALLCHECK as installcheck is the default mode for contrib and\nmodules for performance reasons in the buildfarm.\n\nAuthor: Michael Paquier\nReviewed-by: Andrew Dunstan\nDiscussion: https://postgr.es/m/20181126054302.GI1776@paquier.xyz\n",
