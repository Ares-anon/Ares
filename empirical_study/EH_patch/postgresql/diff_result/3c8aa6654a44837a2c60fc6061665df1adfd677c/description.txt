    "description": "Fix missing abort checks in pg_backup_directory.c.\n\nParallel restore from directory format failed to respond to control-C\nin a timely manner, because there were no checkAborting() calls in the\ncode path that reads data from a file and sends it to the backend.\nIf any worker was in the midst of restoring data for a large table,\nyou'd just have to wait.\n\nThis fix doesn't do anything for the problem of aborting a long-running\nserver-side command, but at least it fixes things for data transfers.\n\nBack-patch to 9.3 where parallel restore was introduced.\n",
