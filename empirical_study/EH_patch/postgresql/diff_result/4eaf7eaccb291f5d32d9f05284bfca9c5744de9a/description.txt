    "description": "Add missing and dangling downlink checks to amcheck\n\nWhen bt_index_parent_check() is called with the heapallindexed option,\nallocate a second Bloom filter to fingerprint block numbers that appear\nin the downlinks of internal pages.  Use Bloom filter probes when\nwalking the B-Tree to detect missing downlinks.  This can detect subtle\nproblems with page deletion/VACUUM, such as corruption caused by the bug\njust fixed in commit 6db4b499.\n\nThe downlink Bloom filter is bound in size by work_mem.  Its optimal\nsize is typically far smaller than that of the regular heapallindexed\nBloom filter, especially when the index has high fan-out.\n\nAuthor: Peter Geoghegan\nReviewer: Teodor Sigaev\nDiscussion: https://postgr.es/m/CAH2-WznUzY4fWTjm1tBB3JpVz8cCfz7k_qVp5BhuPyhivmWJFg@mail.gmail.com\n",
