    "description": "Fix more memory leaks in failure path in buildACLCommands.\n\nWe already had one go at this issue in commit d73b7f973db5ec7e, but we\nfailed to notice that buildACLCommands also leaked several PQExpBuffers\nalong with a simply malloc'd string.  This time let's try to make the\nfix a bit more future-proof by eliminating the separate exit path.\n\nIt's still not exactly critical because pg_dump will curl up and die on\nfailure; but since the amount of the potential leak is now several KB,\nit seems worth back-patching as far as 9.2 where the previous fix landed.\n\nPer Coverity, which evidently is smarter than clang's static analyzer.\n",
