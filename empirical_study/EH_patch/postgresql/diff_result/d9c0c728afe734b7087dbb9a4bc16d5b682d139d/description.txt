    "description": "Fix low-probability memory leak in regex execution.\n\nAfter an internal failure in shortest() or longest() while pinning down the\nexact location of a match, find() forgot to free the DFA structure before\nreturning.  This is pretty unlikely to occur, since we just successfully\nran the \"search\" variant of the DFA; but it could happen, and it would\nresult in a session-lifespan memory leak since this code uses malloc()\ndirectly.  Problem seems to have been aboriginal in Spencer's library,\nso back-patch all the way.\n\nIn passing, correct a thinko in a comment I added awhile back about the\nmeaning of the \"ntree\" field.\n\nI happened across these issues while comparing our code to Tcl's version\nof the library.\n",
