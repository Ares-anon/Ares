    "description": "Fix two low-probability memory leaks in regular expression parsing.\n\nIf pg_regcomp failed after having invoked markst/cleanst, it would leak any\n\"struct subre\" nodes it had created.  (We've already detected all regex\nsyntax errors at that point, so the only likely causes of later failure\nwould be query cancel or out-of-memory.)  To fix, make sure freesrnode\nknows the difference between the pre-cleanst and post-cleanst cleanup\nprocedures.  Add some documentation of this less-than-obvious point.\n\nAlso, newlacon did the wrong thing with an out-of-memory failure from\nrealloc(), so that the previously allocated array would be leaked.\n\nBoth of these are pretty low-probability scenarios, but a bug is a bug,\nso patch all the way back.\n\nPer bug #10976 from Arthur O'Dwyer.\n",
