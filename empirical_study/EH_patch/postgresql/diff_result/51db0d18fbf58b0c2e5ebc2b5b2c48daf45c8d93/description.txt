    "description": "Fix plpgsql to enforce domain checks when returning a NULL domain value.\n\nIf a plpgsql function is declared to return a domain type, and the domain's\nconstraints forbid a null value, it was nonetheless possible to return\nNULL, because we didn't bother to check the constraints for a null result.\nI'd noticed this while fooling with domains-over-composite, but had not\ngotten around to fixing it immediately.\n\nAdd a regression test script exercising this and various other domain\ncases, largely borrowed from the plpython_types test.\n\nAlthough this is clearly a bug fix, I'm not sure whether anyone would\nthank us for changing the behavior in stable branches, so I'm inclined\nnot to back-patch.\n",
