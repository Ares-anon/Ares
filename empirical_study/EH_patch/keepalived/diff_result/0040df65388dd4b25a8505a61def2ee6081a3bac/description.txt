    "description": "Fix memory leak re some uses of ipaddresstos()\n\nMany of the calls to ipaddresstos() weren't freeing the malloc'd\nmemory afterwards. This commit changes ipaddresstos() to use a\nstatic buffer, or a buffer passed to ipaddresstos(), thereby avoiding\nthe use of malloc altogether.\n\nThe commit also simplifies dump_iprule() and dump_iproute() by avoiding\nthe use of intermediate buffers, and reducing the number of malloc's/free's.\n\nSigned-off-by: Quentin Armitage <quentin@armitage.org.uk>\n",
