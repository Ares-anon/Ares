    "description": "Fix memory leak in ssltest\n\nThe new Rand usage of Thread API exposed a bug in ssltest. ssltest \"cheats\"\nand uses internal headers to directly call functions that normally you\nwouldn't be able to do. This means that auto-init doesn't happen, and\ntherefore auto-deinit doesn't happen either, meaning that the new rand locks\ndon't get cleaned up properly.\n\nReviewed-by: Rich Salz <rsalz@openssl.org>\n",
