    "description": "Fix memory leak in session cache test\n\nWhen we are using the internal cache we have to make a copy of the\nsession before removing it from the parent context's cache, since\nwe want our copy to still be resumable.  However, SSL_CTX_remove_session()\njust detaches the session from the SSL_CTX; it does not free the session.\nSo, we must call SSL_SESSION_free() ourselves before overwriting the\nvariable that we dup'd from.\n\nReviewed-by: Rich Salz <rsalz@openssl.org>\n(Merged from https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/4126)\n",
