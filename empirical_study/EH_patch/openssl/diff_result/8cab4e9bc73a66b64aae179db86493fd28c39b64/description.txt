    "description": "Fix memory leak in library deinit\n\nENGINE_cleanup calls CRYPTO_free_ex_data and therefore,\nCRYPTO_cleanup_all_ex_data - which cleans up the method pointers - must\nrun after ENGINE_cleanup.\n\nAdditionally, don't needlessly initialize the EX_CALLBACKS stack during\ne.g. CRYPTO_free_ex_data. The only time this is actually needed is when\nreserving the first ex data index. Specifically, since sk_num returns -1\non NULL input, the rest of the code already handles a NULL method stack\ncorrectly.\n\nReviewed-by: Rich Salz <rsalz@openssl.org>\n",
