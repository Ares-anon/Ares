Interestingly,\nit is not freed when everything succeeds.\n\nRewrite the FD set loop to make it more readable and to not modify the allocated\npointer so it can be freed.\n\nReviewed-by: Andy Polyakov <appro@openssl.org>\nReviewed-by: Paul Dale <paul.dale@oracle.com>\n(Merged from https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/3992)\n",
