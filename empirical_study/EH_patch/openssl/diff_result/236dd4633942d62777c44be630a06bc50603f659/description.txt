I mean as we know, ARM ISA has merged rotate-n-logical\ninstructions which can be used here. And they were used to improve\nkeccak1600-armv4 performance. But not here. Even though this approach\nresulted in improvement on Cortex-A53 proportional to reduction of\namount of instructions, ~8%, it didn't exactly worked out on\nnon-Cortex cores. Presumably because they break merged instructions\nto separate \u03bc-ops, which results in higher *operations* count. X-Gene\nand Denver went ~20% slower and Apple A7 - 40%. The optimization was\ntherefore dismissed.\n\nReviewed-by: Rich Salz <rsalz@openssl.org>\n",
