    "description": "ntlm_wb: Fix theoretical memory leak\n\nStatic analysis indicated that my commit 9008f3d564 (\"ntlm_wb: Fix\nhard-coded limit on NTLM auth packet size\") introduced a potential\nmemory leak on an error path, because we forget to free the buffer\nbefore returning an error.\n\nFix this.\n\nAlthough actually, it never happens in practice because we never *get*\nhere with state == NTLMSTATE_TYPE1. The state is always zero. That\nmight want cleaning up in a separate patch.\n\nReported-by: Terri Oda\n",
